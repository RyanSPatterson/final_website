        <p class="hobbies-text-2">I have always been a passionate gamer and over the last few years I have been able to turn that passion into an exciting side project in streaming.
        <br><br>    
        At first there was a massive learning curve as I had to create and manage my socials, buy and settup the equipment as well as edit videos and create content to name a few. I'm very proud of what I have accomplished, since I began over a year ago I have managed to: </p>

            <li>Feature on several podcasts</li>
            <li>Over 500,000 views</li>
            <li>Learn new technical skills</li>
            <li>Self taught how to edit videos to a high quality

            <p>
            It has been great turning my passion into something that I actually get paid to do as well as <br> 
            this it helps my mental health by focusing me on the project.

                <p> Over the last few years I have learned the importance of looking after not just your physical health but also your mental health. <br> <br>
                That's why I do what I can to support those stuggling with theres. <br><br> Most recently I have worked with a charity called Dis-Lablleed which is <br>
            breaking the stigma around invisible disabilities which are non visual disabilities such as depression, anxiety and ADHD to name a few. </p></p>

            <h2>Fitness and Sports</h2>
            
            <p> Growing up I always had a passion for football and other sports but as I got older the passion deminished overtime as I focused on other things. <br>

            Over the last few years however as I now know first hand what poor mental health can do to you physically it has reignitted that passion. <br>
        
            There honetly nothing better for me and my menteal health than a simple walk, gym session or kick about with my friends.  </p>
